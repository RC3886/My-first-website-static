			<p>
				My name is Roman Červek and I'm from Lipník nad Bečvou.</p>
			<p>
				I graduated from the Gymnázium in Lipník nad Bečvou and then I went to the Faculty of Law of the University of Palacky.
				Unfortunately, I did not finish the last year of this 5 year study here and decided to find a work.
				At first, my work was more of an administrative nature (Labour Office of the Czech Republic), but for some time I also worked in
				as a driver and receptionist for a small guesthouse. After that, I got to the machining company, where I worked in
				business affairs, customer relations, translation and interpreting from English and local network management.
			<p>

			<p>
				During my work, I gradually got from helping colleagues with PC problems to part-time work
				work as a network administrator for a medium-sized company. I realized that I enjoy working in IT more
				than administration or business matters, to which I have devoted a few years. More specifically, software
				development. From a young age, I liked creativity and making things.
				So I decided to learn programming, I specifically decided to focus on <strong>Python</strong> 
				and I have completed accredited courses for <strong>HTML/CSS</strong> and <strong>SQLite</strong>.
			</p>

			<p>
				I am looking for a job as a junior software developer, preferably using Python, but I have no problem learning i
				new languages ​​and applications. After all, I plan to do it in the future anyway.
